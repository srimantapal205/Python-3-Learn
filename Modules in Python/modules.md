## Python Modules
A Python module is a file containing Python code, including functions, classes, and variables. It allows code to be organized logically and reused across multiple programs. The main advantage of using modules is code reusability and maintainability.

A module in Python is simply a .py file that contains definitions (functions, classes, or variables) and can be imported into other Python scripts.

## Types of Python Modules

Python provides three types of modules:

1. Built-in Modules

These come pre-installed with Python and provide various functionalities, such as math, os, sys, datetime, etc.

2. User-defined Modules

These are modules that you create in your own Python projects.

3. External Modules (Third-party Modules)

These modules are installed using pip and extend Pythonâ€™s functionality, such as numpy, pandas, requests, etc.
